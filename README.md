This is the final project for Part 2 of the DIO Impulso JS 2022 Bootcamp. 

It was made for consolidation of html, css and flexbox knowledge acquired through the the 2nd parte of the course, which can be seen [here.](https://pitossomo.github.io/instagram-login-clone/)

Instead of getting the same reference page used by the instructor, the ref for this project was the view of [www.instagram.com] in July 9th, 2022. Hence, it is not identical to the one shown in the course.
